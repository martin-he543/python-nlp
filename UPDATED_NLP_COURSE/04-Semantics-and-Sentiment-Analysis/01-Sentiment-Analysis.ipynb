    "\n",
    "### 1. Polarity classification\n",
    "We won't try to determine if a sentence is objective or subjective, fact or opinion. Rather, we care only if the text expresses a *positive*, *negative* or *neutral* opinion.\n",
    "### 2. Document level scope\n",
    "We'll also try to aggregate all of the sentences in a document or paragraph, to arrive at an overall opinion.\n",
    "### 3. Coarse analysis\n",
    "We won't try to perform a fine-grained analysis that would determine the degree of positivity/negativity. That is, we're not trying to guess how many stars a reviewer awarded, just whether the review was positive or negative."

    "* First, consider the text being analyzed. A model trained on paragraph-long movie reviews might not be effective on tweets. Make sure to use an appropriate model for the task at hand.\n",
    "* Next, decide the type of analysis to perform. In the previous section on text classification we used a bag-of-words technique that considered only single tokens, or *unigrams*. Some rudimentary sentiment analysis models go one step further, and consider two-word combinations, or *bigrams*. In this section, we'd like to work with complete sentences, and for this we're going to import a trained NLTK lexicon called *VADER*."

I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^",

This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.",

The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.",

I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross",
